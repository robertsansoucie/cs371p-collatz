# CS371p: Object-Oriented Programming Collatz Repo

This is a project based on the collatz conjecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) trying to efficiently determine the number between two pairs of numbers that takes the most number of operations to reach 1 according to first paragraph of the wikipedia article. The main file is "Collatz.cpp" and there is an example of sample input and output in RunCollatz.in and RunCollatz.out.
